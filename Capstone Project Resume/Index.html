    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I own and operate multiple businesses concurrently, finding collaborative and efficient ways to take each business to a new level. As my partner and I make strategic investments through our parent organization Clarity Partners, we look for opportunities to raise the bar in each of the organizations in which we have an investment. The HUB of everything is The RAWR Agency, our full-scale advertising and marketing company. Through many years of sales, management and entrepreneurial business development experience I am focused on executive operations management. I've started several small businesses and consulted with others on small business startups. I have a passion for fostering innovation, whether through new ideas or within existing companies. I thrive on creating efficiencies in management and organizational systems in order to create a well operating business. </p><br />
